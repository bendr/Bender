    <h1>Bender</h1>

    <p>Bender is a <em>declarative Web application framework</em>. It is a tool
    to build Web application <em>front-ends</em> using a markup language
    for application and component description, a Javascript runtime engine for
    Web browsers and SVG players, and a library of Javascript support code and
    predefined components. Bender is free software, released under the <a
      href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License v2.0</a>
    and currently under active development.</p>

    <p>Without further ado, let's see a very simple Bender application. The
    complete XML description is reproduced below; to run this application (or
    any other application mentioned below) in your browser, just click on
    the&nbsp;⚐ sign.</p>

    <div class="include-src" data-src="../doc/welcome.xml"
      data-expanded="true">Welcome to Bender!</div>

    <p>This example shows the main elements of a Bender application:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the <span class="elem">app</span> element is the container for the
      description of a complete Bender application;</li>
      <li>the <span class="elem">view</span> element describes how the
      application is rendered; in this case we use HTML;</li>
      <li>the <span class="elem">watch</span> element is used to react to
      changes in a component attribute or property, or to events sent by a
      component: in this case, when we <span class="elem">get</span> a
      <code>@pushed</code> event from the <em>button</em> <span
        class="elem">component</span>, an alert box shows up.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One of the main purposes of Bender is to facilitate the creation of Web
    applications through reusable components. In the above example, we include
    a pre-defined button component in our <span class="elem">view</span>
    (notice that the view description mixes HTML elements, which are rendered
    as is, with the Bender-specific element <span class="elem">component</span>,
    the <span class="elem">view</span> of which will then be rendered.)
    The <span class="attr">href</span> attribute of the element specifies the
    location of the component description and its name. Let's have a look:</p>

    <div class="include-src" data-src="../lib/button.xml"
      data-component="true">Button component</div>

    <p>(Click on the ▸ sign to expand.)</p>
    <p>Above is the description of an HTML push button, that can respond to
    both mouse and touch events (and thus works on both desktop or touch screen
    environments out of the box.) It reacts to being pushed and released, so
    that its state can be visualized, but abstracts this from the including
    application or component by simply sending a <code>@pushed</code> event
    when the button was clicked or tapped.</p>
