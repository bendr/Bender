    <h1>Bender Documentation</h1>
    <p>Version 0.9, Mon 31 Mar 2014</p>
    <p>Bender is an experimental, declarative language for Web application
    authoring. It is built on top of HTML5, Javascript and XML and focuses on
    rich graphical user interfaces. It is free software and is released under
    the <a href="https://github.com/bendr/bender/blob/master/LICENSE">Apache
      License v2.0</a>.</p>
    <p>Bender builds on the idea of declarative languages like HTML, SVG and CSS
    to describe not only the layout of an application, but also its structure
    and its behavior. The building block of a Bender application is the
    component, and an application is described as a hierarchical structure of
    components, how they are laid out in relation to each other, and how they
    interact with each other. These component descriptions can be built through
    a Javascript API, or read and saved in XML. A Bender application is run by
    loading building its main component in the Bender runtime, and running in a
    host application; typically, a Web browser. The <a
      href="https://github.com/bendr/bender/">runtime</a> is written in pure
    Javascript and has no dependency.</p>
    <p>The current documentation consists of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="data-model.html">The Bender Data Model</a> describes the data
      model of Bender: nodes, components, elements, watches, adapters,
      &amp;c.;</li>
      <li><a href="processing-model.html">The Bender Processing Model</a>
      describes the processing model of Bender: the watch graph, view rendering,
      &amp;c.</li>
      <li><a href="runtime.html">The Bender Runtime</a> describes the HTML5
      runtime of Bender.</li>
    </ul>
