    <h1>Bender</h1>

    <p>Bender is a Web application framework consisting of a markup language
    for application and component description, a Javascript runtime engine for
    Web browsers and SVG players, and a library of Javascript support code and
    predefined components. Bender is free software, released under the <a
      href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License v2.0</a>
    and currently under active development.</p>

    <p>Bender follows loosely the Model-View-Controller pattern, where
    <em>models</em> can be seen as data stored on the application back-end
    (<em>e.g.</em> in a database server-side, or using HTML5 Web storage
    facilities client-side), <em>views</em> are concrete nodes in a target DOM
    tree rendered by the host browser or viewer, and <em>controllers</em> are
    Javascript objects sending and receiving <em>events</em>, and connected to
    other parts of the application through <em>outlets</em>.</p>

    <p>Without further ado, let's see a very simple Bender application. The
    complete XML description is reproduced below; to run this application (or
    any other application mentioned below) in your browser, just click on
    the&nbsp;â–¶ sign.</p>

    <div class="include-src" data-src="../doc/welcome.xml"
      data-expanded="true">Welcome to Bender!</div>

    <p>This example shows the main elements of a Bender application:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the <span class="elem">app</span> element is the container for the
      description of a complete Bender application;</li>
      <li>the <span class="elem">view</span> element describes how the
      application is rendered; in this case we use HTML;</li>
      <li>the <span class="elem">controller</span> element describes a
      controller object that in this case <span class="elem">listen</span>s to
      events from a button <span class="elem">component</span>.
    </ul>

    <p>Running a Bender application consists of loading its description and
    related resources, such as included components, external scripts and
    stylesheets; creating prototypes for components and controllers; rendering
    views in the host browser; then setting up connections between concrete
    nodes and controller instances.</p>

    <p>One of the main purposes of Bender is to facilitate the creation of Web
    applications through reusable components. In the above example, we include
    a pre-defined button component in our <span class="elem">view</span>
    (notice that the view description mixes HTML elements, which are rendered
    as is, with the Bender-specific element <span class="elem">component</span>,
    the <span class="elem">view</span> of which will then be rendered.)
    The <span class="attr">href</span> attribute of the element specifies the
    location of the component description and its name. Let's have a look:</p>

    <div class="include-src" data-src="../lib/button.xml">Button
      component</div>

    <p>Above is the description of an HTML push button, that can respond to
    both mouse and touch events (and thus works on both desktop or touch screen
    environments out of the box.) It reacts to being pushed and released, so
    that its state can be visualized, but abstracts this from the including
    application or component by simply sending a <code>@pushed</code> event
    when the button was clicked or tapped.</p>
