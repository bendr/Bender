<component>

  Not stored in the tree but kept in memory. Loaded components can probably be
  kept as their own document and need not be imported in the context?

  [ ] Keep track of their URI for relative URIs
  [ ] Default paths for component loading

  @id (?) -- can be referred to by href

  <view> (?) -- rendering of that component
  <property> (*) -- component properties


<context>

  Virtual view for a runtime context.

  [x] Just add instances to context.documentElement and you're in business


<instance>

  Instances of components
