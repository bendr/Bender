TODO list as of 2012-02-21 (v0.3.2)


REVIEW

[x] Watch event listeners (listener at context level?)
[ ] Lexical vs. dynamic bindings
[x] Property names (dashes and $ sign)


BUGS

[x] Watch nesting: listening to the same event (e.g. nesting @xhr-success to
    chain two XMLHttpRequests)
    [ ] Make a test case to test more thoroughly
[x] Watches through component boundaries (regression -> watch-8.xml)
[!] Watch loops (more tests needed!)
    [-] Setting properties in a row
[!] Checkbox test
[x] Initial setup of component properties
[x] Button regression
[x] Get transformed called even on disabled watches
[ ] Some styles not applied properly with external stylesheets
[ ] Flexo: flexo.absolute_uri("foo/bar/baz", "..") -> "/" ???


FEATURES

[ ] get/@href for XMLHttpRequest?
[x] watches: get/disable instead of watch/once
[ ] watches: everything goes through events
[ ] binding rules?
[x] <get attr="...">
[x] <set view="..." property="...">
[x] Attribute binding (cf. tests/fail/button.xml)
    [x] use {} formatting for the attribute value (e.g. class for button)
    [x] use {{ }} for properties (rather than value)
    [ ] several bindings in the same attribute (e.g. {{firstname}} {{lastname}})
[/] <and> element (in <watch>) (tests/watch-and.xml)
[ ] <repeat> element (in <watch>)
[ ] Watch delays
[ ] Signals
[ ] Component inheritance
[/] Adding nodes
    [x] add <component> adds to the list of definitions in the context
    [x] add <use> together with render_in
[/] Removing nodes
    [x] remove <component> deletes the definition
    [ ] remove <use> elements
[ ] Refer to content node (draggable)
[ ] Get matching a specific value?
[x] Script ran on instantiation -> <set> within views/uses
    [ ] insert text in the right location
[x] on-event attribute -> similar to watch/get@event/set
[x] on... attributes -> override with addEventListener to set this property
[ ] Set attributes on <use> even when not set in the original component
[ ] Sequencing watches: store/recall presets
[ ] Parameters for <use> (cf. test/fails/ko-params.xml)
[ ] Change <content> of component (e.g. change button label)
[ ] Clean up SVG demo from ET2011
[ ] Replace app rendering with <use>/render_in


COMPONENTS

[/] Full-fledged audio component: scrubbing, scrolling, time display, zooming...
[/] Prompt with autocompletion
[ ] Calendar
[/] Sound for buttons
[/] Draggable div -> lib/draggable.xml
[ ] Resizable div


MORBO

[/] Fix sound serving for Quicktime
[ ] Pages for errors
