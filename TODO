Bender TODO list as of 2011-11-17 (v0.2.2)


* Bugs

[ ] <include> bug inside components (within components?)
[ ] relative URIs in included files should be relative to that file


* Core Features

[ ] Tree modification
    [ ] Pull components into an existing document
[/] Replace <bind> with <watch>/<get>/<set>
    [x] remove <listen>
    [/] add action to <get> (core/tests/svg-clock)
    [ ] adapt content for set/@view with no property/attr (e.g. text vs. nodes)
    [ ] factor code for watches
    [ ] retrieve old value
    [ ] a property changed in a component should trigger a get in another
        component looking at that property -> generate an event automatically
[ ] Component extension
    [ ] core/tests/uber-clock*
[ ] Readd <connect> and remove link from controller to component
    [ ] underspecified <connect> for component extension?
[ ] In general, review the roles of <controller> and <component>; is
      <controller> just a component without a view?
[ ] Generate new ids from component instances
    [ ] handle stylesheets
[ ] Metadata (at least xml:lang)
    [ ] help/about element
[ ] Undash names from XML
[ ] Keep namespace prefixes around for resolution of attribute names in <watch>
[ ] Attribute for local scripts; for both controllers and components
[ ] Access to host viewBox for SVG documents
[ ] "reuse" attribute to avoid copying elements over and over; values: "none"
      (always create), "any" (any element with the same name) "same" (same name
      and same attributes). Then copy the attributes, possibly overwriting them,
      as in <svg viewBox="x y w h" bender:reuse="any"/>. Children are appended.


* Library

[ ] Review metro -> @tick
[ ] Selection controller
[ ] Command manager controller
[ ] Clipboard controller
[ ] Drag-and-drop controller

[ ] Very Simple Backend -> Bender Server, where the Bender can be used as a
      sort of templating system?
