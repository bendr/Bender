Bender TODO list as of 2011-12-16 (v0.3.0)


* Bugs

[x] editor bug when loading core/test/arrows.xml?
[x] watch/get/@dom-event solved *after* rendering
[x] No SVG display? (width issue; fixed)


* Core Features

[/] Cleanup after rendering
[ ] base attribute for location of relative paths (when using the file chooser)
[ ] Initialization and ordering of watches
[/] Tree modification
    [/] Pull components into an existing document
[/] Replace <bind> with <watch>/<get>/<set>
    [x] remove <listen>
    [x] add action to <get> (core/tests/svg-clock)
    [ ] adapt content for set/@view with no property/attr (e.g. text vs. nodes)
    [x] retrieve old value ("previous_value")
    [ ] a property changed in a component should trigger a get in another
        component looking at that property -> generate an event automatically
    [ ] several <watch>es with the same <get>
[ ] Component extension
    [ ] core/tests/uber-clock*
[x] Generate new ids from component instances
    [ ] handle stylesheets
[ ] Metadata (at least xml:lang)
[x] desc element
[x] Undash property names
    [x] Prefix with $
[ ] Keep namespace prefixes around for resolution of attribute names in <watch>
[/] <local-script> for components
    [ ] href attribute
    [ ] error handling
[/] "reuse" attribute to avoid copying elements over and over; values: "none"
      (always create), "any" (any element with the same name) "same" (same name
      and same attributes), "#id" (match an existing id.) Then copy the
      attributes, possibly overwriting them, as in <svg viewBox="x y w h"
          bender:reuse="any"/>. Children are appended.
    [/] "any"
    [ ] "same" (???)
    [ ] "#id"
    [ ] @bender:render-once
[ ] Merge controller and component; make <view> mandatory for components with a
      view.
    [ ] Readd <connect>?
        [ ] underspecified <connect> for component extension
[ ] Search path for components: name vs. href
    [ ] import names components
