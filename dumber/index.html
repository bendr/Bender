      <h2>Manual</h2>

      <section id="manual.start">
        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <p>Using Dumber just requires including the <a
        href="../flexo.js"><code>flexo.js</code></a> (the support library for
        Dumber) and <a href="dumber.js"><code>dumber.js</code></a> Javascript
        files in the host document (<em>e.g.</em>, in <code>script</code>
        tags.) See for example the above test documents.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="manual.context">
        <h3>The context</h3>
        <p>The <em>context</em> is the document hosting Dumber nodes. The root
        of the document is a <code>context</code> element, which should only be
        used as the root a Dumber tree. <code
        class="def">dumber.create_context(target)</code> creates a new context
        with a rendering target specified by <code class="param">target</code>
        (or the current document by default.) If the target is a DOM
        <code>Element</code> (<em>e.g.</em> the body of an HTML document, or a
        <code>g</code> element in an SVG document), rendered nodes will be
        appended to the given target. In other cases (<em>e.g.</em>, when the
        target is a <code>Document</code> node, which is the default),
        individual components may be rendered by specifying a target node. The
        <code class="param">context</code> root element is returned (not the
        context document itself, which can be accessed through the DOM
        <code>ownerDocument</code> property of any node in the document.)</p>
      </section>

      <section id="manual.nodes">
        <h3>Dumber nodes</h3>
        <p>Nodes in the Dumber tree overload common DOM methods so that changes
        can be tracked and reflected after rendering was done. Component
        elements, such as the context root element, have a convenience method
        <code class="def">$(name, attributes, ...)</code> to create new
        nodes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code class="param">name</code> parameter may be qualified
          with a known namespace prefix (<code>html</code> or
          <code>xhtml</code>, <code>svg</code>, <code>xlink</code>,
          <code>xml</code>, <code>xmlns</code>; the Dumber namespace is used if
          there is no prefix) and may include an id prefixed by <code>#</code>
          and a list of class names prefixed by <code>.</code>. For example, the
          name string <code>html:div#body.calculator</code> describes an
          HTML <code>div</code> element with id <code>body</code> and class
          <code>calculator</code>, while <code>use</code> describes a Dumber
          <code>use</code> element. <strong>Note</strong>: id must come before
          classes.</li>
          <li>The <code class="param">attributes</code> parameters is an object
          which keys are attribute names and values attribute values. For
          example, <code>{ q: "app" }</code> sets the <code>q</code> attribute
          to <code>app</code> for the node being created. A <code>null</code> or
          <code>undefined</code> value for an attribute will not set it.  This
          parameter can be omitted.</li>
          <li>The following parameters (if any) are the contents of the node.
          Valid content is either a string, which creates a text node, and other
          nodes, usually created themselves through the <code>$</code>
          method.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Node manipulation is done through the DOM methods <code
          class="def">appendChild</code>, <code class="def">insertBefore</code>,
        <code class="def">setAttribute</code>, and <code
        class="def">setAttributeNS</code>. Additionally, Dumber nodes have a
        <code class="def">_textContent(text)</code> method to replace setting
        the <code>textContent</code> property, which can still be read normally
        (and also be set, but changes will not cause the rendering to update.)
        Dumber nodes have an internal method <code class="def
        internal">_refresh(parent)</code> which will refresh the rendering for
        the parent of this node (which defaults to <code>parentNode</code> if
        not specified; the parameter is needed mostly for updates after a node
        has been removed from its parent.) It should not be necessary to call
        this method under normal circumstances.</p>
        <p>Since a Dumber tree may be modified at runtime, it can be serialized
        again through the <code class="def">_serialize()</code> method. This
        simply returns a text string of the XML serialization of the current
        state of the Dumber tree. This method is available on any node, so it
        may be used for instance for the main application or a given component
        rather than the full context.</p>

        <section id="manual.nodes.component">
          <h4>The component, app and context nodes</h4>
          <p>The <code class="node">component</code> node describes a Dumber
          component.  <code class="node">app</code> is synonymous with
          <code>component</code> and is provided to describe the main component
          of a Dumber application. <code class="node">context</code> is also a
          synonym and is used as the root of the Dumber tree (and as such should
          not be used elsewhere.) A component may have metadata, a view,
          scripts, watches, and sub-components. These are described by the
          following nodes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code class="node">desc</code> contains textual description for
            the component. This is used as metadata; for intance, it can be used
            to give hints about the usage of this component.</li>
            <li><code class="node">script</code> allows customizing the behavior
            of a component through Javascript.</li>
            <li><code class="node">title</code> contains the title of the
            component as plain text. This is used mostly as metadata, but gets
            rendered as the document title when it is the child of an
            <code>app</code> element which in turn is the child of a
            <code>context</code> root element.</li>
            <li><code class="node">use</code> creates a new instance of a
            component and renders it in this component's view (including in a
            <node>context</code> node; see below.) <code>use</code> nodes should
            appear as descendants of the <code>view</code> node of the
            component.</li>
            <li><code class="node">view</code> contains foreign nodes that will
            be rendered in the target document when this component is rendered.
            A component may have only one view; setting a new view automatically
            replaces the previous one.</li>
            <li><code class="node">watch</code> describes the behavior of the
            component in the face of changes in its properties and events it
            receives. See the section on watches below.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All Dumber nodes may have an <code class="attr">id</code> attribute
          which should be unique in the document where the node appears (if
          importing nodes from different documents, nodes with the same id can
          be distinguished by the URL of the original document.) These ids are
          not rendered since many instances of the same component may be
          rendered in a document.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="manual.nodes.use">
          <h4>The use node</h4>
          <p>The <code class="node">use</code> node instantiates and renders a
          component. For every <code>use</code> node, a new <em>instance</em> of
          a component is created; if this component has a view, or has
          <code>use</code> children that themselves have a view (at any level of
          nesting) then the contents of the view gets rendered in its place.</p>
          <p>The component to be instantiated is designated by one of the
          following attributes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code class="attr">q</code> (short for <em>query
            selector</em>) to refer to a node in the current context (TODO check
            the exact context of the querySelector call); note that using
            <code>#</code> for id may not work, so it is safer to use
            <code>ref</code> below in that situation;</li>
            <li><code class="attr">ref</code> to refer to the id of a node in
            the current document;</li>
            <li><code class="attr">href</code> (TODO)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additional attributes (besides <code class="attr">id</code>) and
          contents of the <code>use</code> nodes are passed to the instantiated
          component view during rendering as described below.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="manual.nodes.view">
          <h4>The view and content nodes</h4>
          <p>The <code class="node">view</code> node contains foreign nodes
          (<em>e.g.</em>, HTML, SVG, etc.) describing the actual rendering of a
          component. <code>view</code> may also include <code>use</code> and
          <code>content</code> nodes (other Dumber nodes are silently ignored),
          as well as text nodes. Additionally, <code>use</code> nodes outside of
          a <code>view</code> node are also rendered as siblings of the children
          of the <code>view</code> node.</p>
          <p>When a component is rendered, the contents of the view are copied
          as is (minus id attributes as discussed above) into the target
          element. <code>use</code> nodes allow to include Dumber components
          inside another component. The <code class="node">content</code> allows
          to customize the rendering of a node by replacing this node with the
          contents of the original <code>use</code>. The <code>content</code>
          node may have content of its own, which is the default content that
          gets rendered when the <code>use</code> has no content.</p>
          <p>Similarly, attributes of the <code>use</code> node are added to the
          top-level elements that get rendered; this allows for instance to
          change the class of an element to alter its rendering.</p>
          <p>TODO: named content elements and shortcuts for bindings.</p>

        <section id="manual.nodes.script">
          <h4>The component instance object and the script node</h4>
          <p>Before rendering, a component gets <em>instantiated</em>, which
          creates a new Javascript object acting as the <em>component
          instance</em> of this component. A component instance has the
          following methods and properties:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code class="def">init(use, component)</code> initializes the
            component after it was created. <code class="param">use</code> is
            the <code>use</code> node instantiating the component, and
            <code class="param">component</code> is the component node being
            instantiated. The instance is returned.</li>
            <li><code class="prop">views</code> maps the id of the foreign nodes
            inside the view of the component and the actual rendered nodes in
            the target. Nodes that do not have an id are not included.</li>
            <li><code class="prop">uses</code> maps the id of <code>use</code>
            nodes inside the view of the component and the instance that was
            created. Nodes that do not have an id are not included.</li>
            <li><code class="def">instantiated()</code> is called <em>after</em>
            the instance was created and initialized, and right before it will
            be rendered. By default, it does not do anything but can be
            overloaded for component customization.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <code class="node">script</code> node contains custom
          Javascript code. This code is executed when the node is instantiated
          defines a variable <code class="param">prototype</code> to access the
          <em>prototype</em> of the component that it is part of. It is
          therefore possible to overload the base component's methods as well as
          add new methods to that component. A good entry point for
          initialization is the <code>instantiated</code> method.</p>
          <p><strong>Properties</strong>: instances have properties (Javascript
          values) that can be set directly from Dumber attributes. Attributes in
          the namespace <code>http://dumber.igel.co.jp/p</code> or prefixed with
          <code>p:</code> (when using the <code>$</code> convenience function to
          create nodes) on <code>component</code> and <code>use</code> nodes
          sets the value of a property with the same name as the attribute. When
          set on a <code>component</code> node, all instances will have this
          property with the value as default; when set on a <code>use</code>
          node, then only that instance will have that property (or value if the
          component also has that property.) Instances have a <code
          class="param">properties</code> field that holds the properties.</p>

        <p>A self-contained Dumber application tree can be rendered into any

        target, populating the tree, and having a <code>use</code> element as a
        child of the root element pointing to the main application component.
        Here is <a href="tests/hello.html">a simple HTML "Hello, world!"

        <h3>Rendering a Dumber component in a document</h3>
        <p>Another use case is to render individual components into an existing

          class="param">target</code> is the parent DOM node where the content
