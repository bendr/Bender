Bender; or, a Web application framework.
Copyright Â© 2011, IGEL Co., Ltd. (http://www.igel.co.jp/bender/)


Bender is a Web application framework consisting of a markup language for
application and component description, a Javascript runtime engine for Web
browsers and SVG players, and a library of Javascript support code and
predefined components. Bender is free software, released under the Apache
License v2.0 and currently under active development.


Install and run Bender

  To install Bender, simply make the contents of this directory accessible
  through a Web server. Then, let $BENDER_HOME be the URL of this directory.
  (Note: you may also run Bender from the file system with Webkit/Safari, but
  this will cause security exceptions in other browsers.)

  To view the documentation, point your browser to $BENDER_HOME. You can run
  Bender applications by pointing your browser to

    $BENDER_HOME/core/bender.html?app=$RELATIVE_PATH

  where $RELATIVE_PATH is the path to your application description file
  relative to this directory. Your file must have a .xml extension, and the
  extension is *NOT* included in the $RELATIVE_PATH. For example, if you add a
  new application `foo.xml` to the apps directory, then $RELATIVE_PATH will be
  apps/foo.xml. See the documentation for some examples.

  For more debug info, you can set the debug flag to true. This will show a
  status indicator and an error message when something goes wrong (and in the
  future filter out debug messages from the console.)

    $BENDER_HOME/core/bender.html?app=$RELATIVE_PATH&debug=1

  You can also use a pure SVG launcher at:

    $BENDER_HOME/core/bender.svg?app=$RELATIVE_PATH

  For more information, please refer to the documentation (in progress) at:

    $BENDER_HOME/doc/index.html

  This is a very early release of Bender (v0.2.1, 2011-10-xx) and as such is

  Bender is free software, released under the Apache License v2.0 (see included
  LICENSE file.) Please contact bender@igel.co.jp for comments, questions, etc.
