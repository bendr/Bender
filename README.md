# Bender; or, a declarative Web application framework.

Copyright Â© 2011, 2012 [IGEL Co., Ltd.](http://www.igel.co.jp/bender/)

Bender is an experimental, declarative Web application authoring framework based
on XML, Javascript and Web technologies, and with a focus on rich graphical user
interfaces. Bender is free software and is released under the Apache License
v2.0 (see included
[LICENSE](https://github.com/bendr/bender/blob/master/LICENSE) file.)

Bender builds on the idea of declarative languages like HTML, SVG and CSS to
describe not only the layout of an application, but also its structure and its
behavior. The building block of a Bender application is the component, and an
application is described as a hierarchical structure of components, how they
are laid out in relation to each other, and how they interact with each other.
These component descriptions can be built in memory or read and saved in XML. A
Bender application is run by loading or building its main component in the
Bender runtime, and running in a host application; typically, a Web browser. The
runtime is written in pure Javascript and has no dependency.
